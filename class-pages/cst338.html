                <p class="project-description">
                    In this lab, we explored object-oriented programming concepts including
                    <strong>inheritance</strong> and <strong>abstraction</strong> using a
                    Monster-based class design.
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    We began by defining a <strong>Monster interface</strong> that declared
                    common behaviors shared by all monsters. Concrete monster classes were
                    then created as child classes that implemented this interface.
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    To further practice abstraction, we introduced <strong>abstract classes</strong>
                    to represent monster subtypes, such as a <em>Fire-type monster</em>.
                    These abstract classes provided shared functionality while leaving
                    specific behaviors to be implemented by subclasses.
                </p>

                <p class="project-description">
                    Finally, we created <strong>concrete monster implementations</strong>
                    that extended the abstract subtype classes and fully defined all required
                    methods. This structure demonstrated how abstraction and inheritance can
                    be combined to create flexible, reusable, and well-organized code.

                    <h3 class="project-title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        This course strengthened my understanding of software design principles
                        and how to structure programs in a way that is maintainable, scalable,
                        and easy to extend. I learned how proper abstraction, interfaces, and
                        design patterns help reduce code duplication and improve flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        I also gained experience thinking about design decisions before writing
                        code, rather than refactoring heavily later. This mindset helped me
                        better understand real-world software architecture.

                    <p class="project-description">
                        My favorite topic in this class was learning and applying
                        <strong>design patterns</strong>. I especially enjoyed working with
                        the <strong>Command</strong>, <strong>Factory</strong>, and
                        <strong>Singleton</strong> patterns.
                    </p>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        These patterns demonstrated strong techniques for organizing code,
                        managing object creation, and decoupling components. Understanding
                        when and why to use these patterns helped me write cleaner and more
                        professional-level code.
